# Byway GIS Routes

These files contain the GIS version of the byways collection across
the United States as known to the National Scenic Byways Program (NSBP).
These routes were defined as well as possible.

## America's Byways

This file contains route information for all All-American Roads and National
Scenic Byways.

## All Byways

This contains route information for all known routes designated as scenic
byways by various State and federal organizations, including those in the
America's Bwyays file.  This list may be incomplete.

## Key

Both of these files contain the byway name, state code, designation code,
columns with flag for each type of designation, and official designation (most
byways will have more than one designation).  When a byway route has multiple
designations, the highest ranking route is the one that is presented -- for
example the portion of a byway with a federal designation may be smaller than
the portion with a State designation due to designation rules and restrictions.

The designations in order of ranking:

 * NSB   -- All-American Road or National Scenic Byway
 * USFS  -- U.S. Forest Service Scenic Byway
 * NPS   -- National Park Service designated byway
 * BLM   -- Bureau of Land Management or State Backway designated byway
 * STATE -- State designated byway
 * OTHER -- A byway with any other designation
