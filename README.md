# National Scenic Byways

This repository contains data obtained from the byways.org website, which
operated from 1998 to 2013 under the direction of the U.S. Federal
Highway Administration. In late 2013 a subset of the data was moved to
internal hosting and is viewable at https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways.

The owner of this repository has access to the original PostgreSQL database,
associated file assets, and website source code. The goal is to make the
public travel-related structured data available to the public, as it was
produced with public funding.

## Disclaimer

This information was last updated in September 2013, and no guarantee is
made to its continual accuracy. Road conditions, services available, and
tourism contacts are especially subject to change. Use and distribute at
your own risk.

## Loading Data

### PostgreSQL

The PostgreSQL database dump requires the PostGIS extension. Use the
`pg_restore` command to load it into an empty database:

```bash
pg_restore -d byways --no-owner --no-privileges < byways.pgdump
```

The dump file was created from PostgreSQL 10.1 with PostGIS 2.4.2.
